Research in the Oâ€™Connell lab is seeking to understand the neural mechanisms underpinning high-level cognition. This work comprises both basic and translational research, employing pscyhophysics and computational modelling in combination with a range of psychophysiological techniques including EEG, fMRI, autonomic system measurement and transcranial stimulation. Our primary research interests include perceptual decision making, performance monitoring, and attention.
